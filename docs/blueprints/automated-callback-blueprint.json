The process explained in this blueprint adds calls to a workbin or holding queue and calculates the estimated wait time (EWT), timing the callback to match the time the caller would have spent on hold as closely as possible. While a caller's number waits in the holding queue, you can view it and even delete it, if necessary. To initiate the callback after the EWT, a data action adds the number to an agentless always-running outbound dialing campaign on Genesys Cloud. You can choose to have the person receiving the callback confirm that they still need help or send the call directly to an agent. By using a specially-configured holding queue for callback numbers, you can easily filter for these callbacks in reports.\n---"}]}], "failed": [{"id": "link_2", "level": "error", "description": "Image links in the README.md file is missing alternative text.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "README.md", "lineNumber": 7, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Automate callbacks using agentless, always-running Campaigns and Data Actions](blueprint/images/bpAutoCallbkOverview.png)"}]}, {"id": "link_3", "level": "error", "description": "Image links in the index.md file is missing alternative text.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 188, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Configure an agentless campaign](./images/bp-autocallbk-dialingmodes.png)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 191, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Enable \"Always Running\"](./images/bp-autocallbk-alwaysrunning.png)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 194, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Call Analysis Response configuration](./images/bp-autocallbk-responseactions.png)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 229, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "  ![Configure Action Blocks 72 and 91 of the inbound flow](./images/bp-autocallback-inqueueflow-72.png)"}]}, {"id": "link_4", "level": "error", "description": "Hyperlinks in the README.md file is missing alternative text.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "README.md", "lineNumber": 3, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "> View the full [Automated Callback Blueprint article](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/blueprints/automated-callback-blueprint/) on the Genesys Cloud Developer Center."}, {"path": "README.md", "lineNumber": 7, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Automate callbacks using agentless, always-running Campaigns and Data Actions](blueprint/images/bpAutoCallbkOverview.png)"}]}, {"id": "link_5", "level": "error", "description": "Hyperlinks in the index.md file is missing alternative text.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 15, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "please see our Genesys Cloud blueprint [FAQ](https://developer.genesys.cloud/blueprints/faq)sheet."}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 95, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 96, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "- [Solution components](#solution-components)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 97, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 98, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "  -
