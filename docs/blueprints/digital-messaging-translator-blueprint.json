The messaging translation assistant automatically translates everything in the right side of the Interactions panel in real-time, including canned responses. This solution supports both web chat and web messaging interactions. You can deploy all the components used in this solution with the Terraform Genesys Cloud CX as Code provider.\n---"}]}, {"id": "content_2", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md file's front matter must include the following fields: title, author, indextype, icon, image, category, and summary", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 2, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "title: Build a messaging translation assistant with the AWS Translate service"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 3, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "author: agnes.corpuz"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 4, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "indextype: blueprint"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 5, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "icon: blueprint"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 6, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "image: images/banner.png"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 7, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "category: 6"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 8, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "summary: |"}]}, {"id": "content_3", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md must have a '## Scenario' section describing the problem the blueprint is trying to solve.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 23, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "## Scenario"}]}, {"id": "content_4", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md must have a '## Solution' section describing how blueprint solves the project.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 33, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "## Solution"}]}, {"id": "content_6", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md file must have a '## Prerequisites' section that describes the skillset and technical requirements an individual must have to successfully install the blueprint.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 48, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "## Prerequisites"}]}, {"id": "content_7", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md file should have '### Specialized knowledge' section that enumerates the skill sets that the implementor should possess in order to carry out the blueprint.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 50, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "### Specialized knowledge"}]}, {"id": "content_8", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md file should have a '## Implementation steps' section that enumerates the steps necessary to carry out the blueprint implementation.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 73, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "## Implementation steps"}]}, {"id": "content_9", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md file should have a '### Download the repository containing the project files' section that describe how to clone the blueprint repository from GitHub.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 75, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "### Download the repository containing the project files"}]}, {"id": "content_10", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md should have a  '## Additional resources' section containing the project files section.
