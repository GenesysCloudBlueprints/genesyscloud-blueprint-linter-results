Analyzing API usage is essential to optimize and scale any solution that uses the API. The blueprint provides a sample workflow that shows you how to monitor and analyze usage for unexpected issues that have business impact, such as rate limiting. This enables you to adjust any affected applications promptly. This blueprint also includes an example integration that shows how to export the usage data to an AWS S3 bucket and use AWS Athena to process queries against it.\n---"}]}, {"id": "link_1", "level": "error", "description": "Image links in index.md file should point to a valid image file.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 13, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Diagram](images/overview.png)"}]}, {"id": "content_2", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md file's front matter must include the following fields: title, author, indextype, icon, image, category, and summary", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 2, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "title: Query your API usage using the Genesys Cloud CLI and analyze it with AWS S3/Athena"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 3, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "author: prince.merluza"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 4, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "indextype: blueprint"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 5, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "icon: blueprint"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 6, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "image: images/card-image.png"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 7, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "category: 6"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 8, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "summary: |"}]}, {"id": "content_3", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md must have a '## Scenario' section describing the problem the blueprint is trying to solve.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 15, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "## Scenario"}]}, {"id": "content_4", "level": "error", "description": "The index.md must have a '## Solution' section describing how blueprint solves the project.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 19, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "## Solution"}]}], "failed": [{"id": "link_5", "level": "error", "description": "Hyperlinks in the index.md file is missing alternative text.", "fileHighlights": [{"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 13, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "![Diagram](images/overview.png)"}, {"path": "blueprint/index.md", "lineNumber": 78, "lineCount": 1, "lineContent": "* If you have not already done so, set up the CLI using the instructions in [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/command-line-interface/ \"Opens the Command Line Interface (CLI) page\") in the Developer Center.
